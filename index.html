      <h2>Assignment</h2>
      <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> A (k,g)-graph is a regular graph of valency k and length of shortest cycle g. It
was shown that for each pair of parameters (k,g) there exists infinitely many
graphs. The graph of the smallest order, which we will denote n(k,g), among
these graphs is called a (k,g)-cage. To find a (k,g)-cage for given parameters is
so called Cage Problem. Cages are known only for few pairs of parameters. It
is computationally very difficult to prove that some (k,g)-graph is a cage. The
smallest known (k,g)-graph, that was not yet proven to be a cage is called a
record rec(k,g)-graph. Constructions of cages and record graphs, studying their
properties and variations to Cage problem is very active research area.</p>
      <p><strong>Aim:</strong> Sachs in his work conjectured that for each pair of parameters k,g, there exists
a cage that is Hamiltonian. The aim of the theses is to design, run and analyze
experiments on known cages and record graphs and analyze their Hamiltonicity.</p>
